Found this Feynman quote while diving into some old physics books today. It perfectly captures something I've been thinking about in my own work.

You can memorize all the technical terms in neural rendering - BRDF, Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling - but until you've implemented a path tracer from scratch, debugged why your shadows look wrong, and felt the frustration of convergence issues... you don't really *know* these concepts.

There's a difference between surface knowledge and deep understanding. The former gets you through interviews. The latter gets you through the 3 AM debugging sessions when nothing works and you have to really understand what's happening under the hood.

Feynman knew this. He could explain complex physics to anyone because he truly understood it, not just the vocabulary around it.
