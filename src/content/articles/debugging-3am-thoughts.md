It's almost 4 AM and I'm staring at this segmentation fault that makes absolutely no sense. The pointer looks valid, the memory seems allocated, but somehow my neural network is crashing when trying to access the weight matrices.

And it got me thinking... isn't debugging just like life?

You think you understand how things work. You've read the documentation (the rulebook of existence), you've written tests (made plans), you've been careful with memory management (tried to be responsible). But then reality hits you with a segfault at runtime.

The stack trace shows you exactly where things went wrong, but not *why*. Just like how you can pinpoint the moment a relationship ended or a project failed, but the root cause is buried somewhere in the complex interaction of a thousand small decisions.

I've been stepping through this code with GDB for 2 hours now. Each breakpoint is like a moment of introspection - "What was I thinking here? Why did I assume this would work?"

The worst part? I have this feeling the bug is something embarrassingly simple. Like an off-by-one error, or I forgot to initialize something, or there's a classic double-free hiding somewhere. These kinds of bugs teach you humility faster than any philosophy book.

Maybe that's why I love programming. It's immediate feedback on your understanding of reality. The computer doesn't care about your intentions or how smart you think you are. It just executes what you actually wrote, not what you thought you wrote.

Time to grab more coffee and keep hunting. This neural network isn't going to debug itself.

*Update: Found it. I was overwriting the weight buffer because I miscalculated the tensor dimensions. The bug was indeed embarrassingly simple. Going to bed now.*
