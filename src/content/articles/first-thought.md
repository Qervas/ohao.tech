Just finished redesigning my articles section and I'm thinking about how we've lost something in the age of social media platforms. Everyone's squeezing their thoughts into character limits, posting on someone else's platform, following someone else's algorithm.

There's something liberating about having your own space on the web again. A place where you can write a 5-word thought or a 5000-word essay, share a quote that moved you, or document what you're reading. No engagement metrics. No optimization for the algorithm. Just... thoughts, flowing naturally.

It reminds me of the early web when people had personal homepages. You'd stumble upon someone's site and suddenly get a window into their mind - what they were thinking about, what they were building, what books were on their nightstand.

Maybe we need more of that. More personal portals. More authentic digital spaces.

What do you think? Are we ready to go back to owning our own corners of the internet?
