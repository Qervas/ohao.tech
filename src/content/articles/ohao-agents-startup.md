### The Initiative

Today marks the beginning of my journey to build my first startup product: a multi-agent system designed to simulate a real software company that works through the night while I sleep. I want to create autonomous agents that function like human employees, working continuously over hours, handling tasks across past, present, and future timelines, communicating with each other, and leveraging principles from multi-agent systems and cooperative game theory.

### The Concept: A Virtual Software Company

Rather than just creating standalone agents, I'm building a cohesive team that mimics a real software company structure with:

- **QA Agent**: Continuously checks the codebase for bugs, reviews past issues, and flags current problems
- **PM Agent**: Oversees tasks, prioritizes work based on historical trends and future goals, and assigns jobs
- **Fixer Agent**: Implements fixes and changes, learning from past solutions to improve over time
- **Research Agent**: Looks ahead—suggesting new features, optimizations, or refactors based on trends

These agents won't just react to immediate tasks but will operate with memory of past work, awareness of current priorities, and planning for future needs.

### Why This Matters

We all have the same 24 hours in a day, but what if our work could continue even while we sleep? By creating a realistic simulation of collaborative workers, I aim to build a system where progress happens around the clock, multiplying productivity without sacrificing personal well-being.

### Architecture: Human-Like Collaboration

The core of this system isn't just about individual agents but how they interact:

1. **Continuous Operation Cycles**: Agents will run in regular time loops, simulating a workday that continues even overnight
2. **Communication Hub**: A central message system (like a virtual Slack) where agents post updates and coordinate
3. **Persistent Memory**: Each agent maintains knowledge of past work and decisions
4. **Task Allocation System**: Based on cooperative game theory, agents will "bid" on tasks based on their strengths

### Example Workflow

```
QA Agent: "Found an issue in src/render.cpp, line 45—crashes on edge case X."
PM Agent: "Fixer, take this bug ASAP—it's blocking feature Y."
Fixer Agent: "Done—patch in src/render.cpp. QA, please verify."
QA Agent: "Looks good, closing this."
```

This mimics realistic team interactions, creating a truly autonomous workflow.

### Technical Implementation Plan

For the initial prototype, I'm planning to use:

- A message queue system (possibly RabbitMQ or even a simple shared JSON file) for inter-agent communication
- Persistent storage for agent "memory" using SQLite or similar
- A scheduler system to maintain continuous operation
- LangChain or similar frameworks for the agent behaviors
- Vector databases for knowledge storage

### Challenges Ahead

I anticipate several complex hurdles:

- Creating truly autonomous agents that can operate without supervision for hours
- Building effective memory systems so agents learn from past experiences
- Implementing realistic collaboration patterns based on game theory
- Balancing computational resources for continuous operation
- Developing feedback mechanisms so I can guide and improve the system

### Next Steps

Tomorrow I'll begin implementing the message queue system and defining the basic agent architectures. I aim to have a minimal version with at least two collaborating agents within a week, focusing first on the QA and Fixer roles to establish the core feedback loop.
