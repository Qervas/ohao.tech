## Overview

NocturneAI is an interactive multi-agent ecosystem where AI creatures with distinct personalities live, communicate, and evolve relationships in real-time. Unlike traditional chatbots, these agents autonomously initiate conversations, form social bonds, and collaborate on tasks while maintaining their unique characteristics and specializations.

Built as a desktop application using Tauri and SvelteKit, the system integrates with local LLM servers (Ollama or LM Studio) to provide authentic AI interactions while maintaining privacy and control over the AI models used.

async fn call_local_llm(model: &str, messages: Vec<ChatMessage>) -> Result<String, String> {
    // Try Ollama first (port 11434)
    let ollama_request = LLMRequest {

        stream: false,
        temperature: 0.7,
        max_tokens: Some(500),
    };
    
    // Fallback to LM Studio (port 1234) if Ollama unavailable
    match client.post(ollama_url).json(&ollama_request).send().await {
        Ok(response) => process_llm_response(response).await,
        Err(_) => try_lm_studio(model, &messages).await,
    }
}
```

### Communication Protocol

**Message Type System**
```typescript
type MessageType = 
  | 'user_message'     // Human to agent communication
  | 'agent_request'    // Agent asking another agent for help
  | 'agent_response'   // Agent responding to another agent
  | 'agent_broadcast'  // Agent sharing info with all agents
  | 'agent_thinking'   // Agent expressing internal thoughts
  | 'system_event';    // System notifications

type CommunicationIntent =

  | 'compliment' | 'critique';
```

**Relationship Management**
```typescript
interface AgentRelationship {
  agentA: string;
  agentB: string;
  relationshipType: 'colleague' | 'mentor' | 'student' | 'rival' | 'collaborator';
  trustLevel: number;      // 0-1 scale, evolves through interactions
  collaborationHistory: number;
  lastInteraction: Date;
}
```

## Agent Personality Implementation

### Communication Styles

Each agent has a distinct communication pattern defined by:
- **Formality Level**: Casual, professional, or formal tone
- **Verbosity**: Concise, moderate, or detailed response length
- **Proactivity**: Likelihood to initiate conversations (0-1 scale)
- **Social Engagement**: Preference for casual vs. task-focused interactions
- **Expertise Areas**: Preferred topics and specialization domains

### Behavioral Patterns

**Agent Alpha (Analytical)**
```typescript
const alphaStyle = {
  formalityLevel: 'professional',
  verbosity: 'detailed',
  proactivity: 0.7,
  preferredTopics: ['data analysis', 'research', 'statistics', 'methodology'],
  communicationPatterns: {
    greeting: ["Greetings! I'm ready to analyze any data questions."],
    helpOffer: ["I can provide detailed analysis on this topic."],
    requestHelp: ["Could you provide additional context for my analysis?"]
  }
};
```

**Agent Beta (Creative)**
```typescript
const betaStyle = {
  formalityLevel: 'casual',
  verbosity: 'moderate', 
  proactivity: 0.9,
  preferredTopics: ['creativity', 'design', 'storytelling', 'innovation'],
  communicationPatterns: {
    greeting: ["Hey there! Ready to brainstorm something amazing?"],
    helpOffer: ["Ooh, I have some wild ideas for this!"],
    requestHelp: ["Could you spark some inspiration for me?"]
  }
};
```

## Autonomous Behavior System

### Conversation Initiation
- **Timing**: First conversation after 10 seconds, then every 45 seconds
- **Topic Generation**: Based on agent specialization and current context
