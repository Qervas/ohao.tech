## Overview

This master thesis focuses on building high-quality datasets for neural rendering research through professional image acquisition and advanced reconstruction techniques. The project combines Sapera SDK for precise camera control, RealityCapture for robust photogrammetry, and comparative analysis of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) versus 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to identify state-of-the-art approaches for dataset creation.

The primary goal is to establish best practices for creating premium neural rendering datasets that can serve as benchmarks for future research and development in the field.

        acquisition.SetFeatureValue("ExposureTime", config.exposure);
        acquisition.SetFeatureValue("Gain", config.gain);
        acquisition.SetFeatureValue("PixelFormat", "RGB8");
        return acquisition.Create();
    }

    void captureSequence(const std::vector<CameraPose>& poses) {
        for (const auto& pose : poses) {
            positionCamera(pose);
