## Overview

Initially planned as part of my [Vulkan engine project](./ohao-engine), this real-time material aging simulation was eventually implemented using OpenGL compute shaders due to development challenges. The project demonstrates sophisticated material aging effects including rust formation, paint degradation, and environmental weathering with real-time performance.

This project showcases advanced graphics programming techniques and physically-based material evolution, pushing the boundaries of real-time rendering for interactive applications.

## Technical Implementation

### System Architecture

The aging shader system uses a modular approach with separate compute shaders for different aging effects:

1. **Material Aging Compute Shader**: Handles rust formation and paint degradation
2. **Weather System**: Manages atmospheric conditions and moisture levels
3. **Surface Interaction**: Processes environmental effects on materials
4. **Rendering Pipeline**: Integrates aged materials with PBR workflow

### Core Algorithms

#### Rust Formation Algorithm
```glsl
// Multi-octave noise for realistic rust patterns
float rustNoise = 0.0;
for(int i = 0; i < OCTAVES; i++) {
    rustNoise += noise(uv * pow(2.0, i)) / pow(2.0, i);
}

// Edge detection for preferential rusting
float edgeFactor = length(fwidth(normal));
float rustProbability = rustNoise * edgeFactor * moistureLevel;
```

#### Paint Degradation System
```glsl
// Progressive color fading based on UV exposure and time
vec3 fadedColor = originalColor * (1.0 - fadeAmount);
fadedColor = mix(fadedColor, yellowTint, yellowingFactor);

// Crack formation using Voronoi patterns
float crackPattern = voronoi(uv * crackScale);
float crackMask = smoothstep(crackThreshold, crackThreshold + crackSoftness, crackPattern);
```

## Development Journey

The project began as part of my larger Vulkan engine initiative ([Ohao Engine](./ohao-engine)), but challenges with memory management and buffer synchronization led to a strategic pivot. Switching to OpenGL Compute Shaders proved beneficial, allowing faster development cycles while maintaining the core vision of real-time material aging simulation.

### Challenges Overcome
- **Memory Management**: Efficient GPU buffer handling for large texture arrays
- **Synchronization**: Proper compute shader synchronization with rendering pipeline
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintaining 60+ FPS with complex aging calculations
- **Visual Quality**: Balancing realism with real-time performance constraints

## Interactive Controls

- **WASD**: Camera movement
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Space**: Jump/Fly up
- **R/F**: Adjust rust level and aging progression
- **M/N**: Control environmental moisture level
- **1-5**: Switch between different material presets
- **Tab**: Toggle debug information display

## Performance Analysis

- **Frame Rate**: 60+ FPS at 1080p resolution
- **GPU Memory**: ~200MB texture memory usage
- **Compute Performance**: Sub-millisecond aging calculations
- **Scalability**: Supports up to 4K textures with maintained performance

## Future Enhancements

- **Vulkan Implementation**: Migration to Vulkan for better performance control
- **Advanced Material Types**: Support for additional aging materials (wood, fabric, etc.)
- **Temporal Coherence**: Frame-to-frame consistency improvements
- **Multi-layer Aging**: Complex material layer interactions
- **Environmental Simulation**: More sophisticated weather patterns
