# Journey Through Reinforcement Learning

This session captures my journey through what many consider the definitive textbook on reinforcement learning. Sutton and Barto have created a masterpiece that manages to be both mathematically rigorous and surprisingly accessible.

## Why This Book?

As I dive deeper into neural rendering and 3D graphics, I keep encountering optimization problems that feel like they could benefit from RL approaches. Camera path optimization, scene reconstruction, even hyperparameter tuning - there's a pattern here that classical methods struggle with.

Plus, with all the recent advances in AI, I realized my understanding of RL fundamentals has significant gaps. Time to fix that systematically.

## Reading Approach

I'm taking a methodical approach:
- Read each chapter thoroughly with notes
- Implement key algorithms and examples in Python
- Write posts capturing insights and struggles for each chapter
- Connect concepts to my graphics/rendering work where possible

## Progress Tracking

- **Started**: January 15, 2025
- **Current Chapter**: 3 (Finite Markov Decision Processes)
- **Target Completion**: March 2025
- **Implementation Goal**: Build a simple RL framework alongside reading

## Key Themes I'm Tracking

1. **Mathematical Foundations**: How the formal framework captures intuitive concepts
2. **Algorithm Development**: From basic tabular methods to function approximation
3. **Practical Applications**: Where can I apply these concepts in graphics programming?
4. **Implementation Insights**: What works (and doesn't) when coding these algorithms

This isn't just about reading - it's about building a deep, practical understanding of reinforcement learning that I can apply to real problems.
