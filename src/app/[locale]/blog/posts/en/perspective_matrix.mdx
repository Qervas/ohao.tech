On the learning 3D compute graphics for initial lab. I come into a problem. It's about near/far plane. When I adding more planets into the 3D solar system, some of them were culling for out of the perspective world.

Thus, I want to make some changes on the given perspective matrix $P$, which represents a matrix with d=4, near=3, far=7 and aspect=1.

```cpp
GLfloat P[16] = {4.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,  0.0f,
                 0.0f, 4.0f, 0.0f,   0.0f,
                 0.0f, 0.0f, -2.5f, -1.0f,
                 0.0f, 0.0f, -10.5f, 0.0f};
```

I don't know the meaning of each digits. From [this article](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/opengl-perspective-projection-matrix.html), it demonstrates the maths principles behind it. Took me minutes reading it, And now I could construct a matrix with some variables which make it easier to control the whole perspective projection.

```cpp
GLfloat fov = 60.f * M_PI / 180.0f;  // Convert to radians
GLfloat f = 1.0f / tan(fov / 2.0f);
GLfloat aspect = 1.0f;  // Assuming a square viewport
GLfloat near = 0.01f;
GLfloat far = 15.0f;

GLfloat P[16] = {
    f / aspect, 0.0f, 0.0f,                            0.0f,
    0.0f,       f,    0.0f,                            0.0f,
    0.0f,       0.0f, (far + near) / (near - far),    -1.0f ,
    0.0f,       0.0f, (2 * far * near) / (near - far), 0.0f
};
```
