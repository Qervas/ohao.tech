### Context and Goals

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently captured the attention of researchers and industry veterans for their ability to represent intricate 3D scenes from simple 2D images. My master thesis project aims to push these boundaries further by investigating and comparing various neural rendering techniques (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting) and exploring potential performance improvements. I'm working toward a framework that can generate realistic 3D/VR content at scale, potentially in real-time, for applications in gaming, AR/VR, and scientific visualization.

### Environment Setup and Installation

Last week, I consolidated a stable working environment on Ubuntu with an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti SUPER GPU. I created separate Conda environments to keep each toolset organized:

```bash
# Nerfstudio Environment (Python 3.11)
conda create -n nerfstudio python=3.11
conda activate nerfstudio
pip install nerfstudio

# nerf-pytorch Environment (Python 3.9)
conda create -n py39 python=3.9
conda activate py39

# 3D Gaussian Splatting Environment (Python 3.9)
conda create -n gaussian_env python=3.9
conda activate gaussian_env
```

      Early on, I encountered a NumPy compatibility issue (NumPy 2.0.2 not playing nicely with PyTorch 2.1.2), which I solved by downgrading NumPy to 1.26.4.

### Processing Custom Data and Training

A significant milestone was preparing and running data through Nerfstudio. Here's the pipeline I used:

```bash
# Process images and estimate camera poses
ns-process-data images --data lab/data/2025-03-17-workbench/png \
                      --output-dir lab/data/2025-03-17-workbench/processed

# Train the nerfacto model
ns-train nerfacto --data lab/data/2025-03-17-workbench/processed \
                  --output-dir lab/nerfstudio/processed
```

### Overcoming Rendering Challenges

When rendering the trained model, I encountered and solved several issues:

1. **Checkpoint Loading Error**: Modified `eval_utils.py` to set `weights_only=False`
2. **Performance Enhancement**: Installed tiny-cuda-nn
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch
```
3. **Camera Path Generation**: Used either automatic spiral path or manual path definition
```bash
# Generate spiral path video
ns-render spiral --load-config config.yml \
                --output-path video.mp4 \
                --output-resolution 1280 \
                --seconds 5.0 \
                --fps 30
```

### Next Steps

1. **Optimization**:
   - Experiment with hyperparameters
   - Implement data augmentation
   - Compare training speed across implementations

2. **Integration**:
   - Set up 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline
   - Investigate real-time performance improvements

      This week marked significant progress in establishing our neural rendering pipeline. While we've achieved our initial goals, there's still much to explore in optimizing performance and expanding functionality.
