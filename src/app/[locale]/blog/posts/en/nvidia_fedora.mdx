> Building OpenCV from source with CUDA, cuDNN, and GAPI support on Fedora

### Problem Overview

Building OpenCV from source can be challenging, especially when integrating additional modules like CUDA, cuDNN, and G-API. This process involves navigating through various dependencies, configuration options, and potential pitfalls.

### Initial Analysis

Initially, I considered using pre-built OpenCV binaries, which offer:

- **Ease of Installation**: Simple package manager commands for quick setup.
- **Stability**: Tested versions that work out of the box.
- **Limited Features**: Often lack support for advanced capabilities like GPU acceleration.

While pre-built binaries seemed promising due to their simplicity, the lack of advanced features and customization options led me to explore building from source.

### Transition to Building from Source

Recognizing the limitations of pre-built binaries, I shifted to a more comprehensive approach of building OpenCV from source. This method allows for:

- Full control over included modules and features
- Integration of CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration
- Inclusion of specialized modules like G-API

### Detailed Solution

1. **System Setup**:
```bash
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install cmake gcc gcc-c++ git libpng-devel libtiff-devel libjpeg-devel ffmpeg-devel gtk3-devel qt5-qtbase-devel python3-devel python3-numpy
```

Install CUDA and cuDNN:
- cuda link: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
- cudnn link: https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

Then copy the `*.h` files to `/usr/local/cuda/include` and `*.so` files to `/usr/local/cuda/lib64`. (**With symbolic links**)

2. **Clone Repositories**:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/opencv_build
cd ~/Library/opencv_build
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
```

3. **Clone ade for G-API**:
```bash
cd ~/Library/opencv_build/opencv
git clone https://github.com/opencv/ade.git 3rdparty/ade
```

4. **Configure with CMake**:
```bash
cd ~/Library/opencv_build/opencv
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/Library/opencv_build/opencv_contrib/modules \
      -DWITH_CUDA=ON \
      -DWITH_CUDNN=ON \
      -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=9.0 \
      -DWITH_TBB=ON \
      -DBUILD_opencv_world=ON \
      -DBUILD_opencv_python3=ON \
      -DWITH_QT=ON \
      -DWITH_GSTREAMER=ON ..
```

A more recommended way is to use CMake GUI to configure the build options:
- Tick all options with "cuda"
- Set `CUDA_ARCH_BIN` to the appropriate value for your GPU
- Cancel options you don't need (e.g., java, js)
- Read all configuration options carefully
- `BUILD_opencv_world=ON` to build all modules in one library
- Install openblas: `sudo dnf install openblas-devel`
- Set module path to include contrib modules
- Download and setup Nvidia Video Codec SDK

5. **Build and Install**:
```bash
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

### Testing the Installation

Python code to test OpenCV with CUDA:

```python
import cv2
print(cv2.getBuildInformation())
```

### Conclusion

This approach effectively builds OpenCV with CUDA and cuDNN on Fedora. While the process requires careful management of dependencies and configuration options, the flexibility and performance gains make it worthwhile for developers seeking optimized OpenCV builds.
