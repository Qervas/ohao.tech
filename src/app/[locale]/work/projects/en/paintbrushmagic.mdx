## Key Features

### AI Art Generation
- Integration with OpenAI's DALL-E API for high-quality image generation
- Custom prompt engineering system for better results
- IP-based usage tracking and restrictions
- Support for multiple image styles and ratios

### 3D Product Visualization
- Real-time texture mapping using Three.js
- Interactive product previews with multiple view angles
- Support for multiple product types:
  - Hoodies with customizable colors
  - Canvas prints in various sizes
  - Posters with different finish options

### E-commerce Integration
- Secure payment processing via Stripe
- Order management system with SQLite backend
- Automated order tracking and fulfillment
- Multi-currency support

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
<CodeBlock
  language="javascript"
  code={`
// Three.js Product Renderer
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true, alpha: true });

// Load and apply textures
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
textureLoader.load(imageUrl, (texture) => {
  texture.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;
  material.map = texture;
  material.needsUpdate = true;
});
  `}
/>


### Backend Architecture
<CodeBlock
  language="python"
  code={`
# Flask API endpoint for order processing
@app.route('/generate_order', methods=['POST'])
def generate_order():
    data = request.get_json()
    order_id = next(gen)  # Snowflake ID generator

    conn = get_db_connection(ORDER_DATABASE_FILE)
    # Transaction handling with proper error management
    try:
        conn.execute(
            'INSERT INTO orders (id, image_url, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)',
            (order_id, data['image_url'], ...)
        )
        conn.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        conn.rollback()
        raise e
  `}
/>


### Database Schema
<CodeBlock
  language="sql"
  code={`
    CREATE TABLE clothe_order (
        id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
        image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
        color TEXT NOT NULL,
        size TEXT NOT NULL,
        quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
        address TEXT NOT NULL,
        payment_status INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
        create_date datetime,
        pay_date datetime,
        country TEXT NOT NULL,
        price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
    );
  `}
/>

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Real-time 3D Rendering**
   - Challenge: Achieving smooth texture updates on 3D models
   - Solution: Implemented efficient texture caching and preloading system

2. **Payment Integration**
   - Challenge: Handling international transactions securely
   - Solution: Integrated Stripe's robust payment infrastructure with webhook support

3. **Image Generation Quality**
   - Challenge: Maintaining consistent image quality across different products
   - Solution: Developed custom prompt engineering system and image post-processing

## Future Developments

While the project is currently suspended due to funding limitations, several enhancements were planned:

- Advanced material simulation for better product previews
- Multi-language support for international markets
- Integration with additional AI image generation models
- Automated product fulfillment system

## Project Status

The project demonstrated successful proof of concept but was discontinued due to limited marketing resources. All core functionalities were implemented and tested, with the system successfully processing test orders and generating customized products.
